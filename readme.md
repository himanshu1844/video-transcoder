Scalable Video Transcoding Pipeline using AWS and Docker

This project describes the implementation of a scalable, event-driven video transcoding pipeline that processes uploaded video files, transcodes them into multiple resolutions, and stores optimized versions on Amazon S3. The system uses AWS cloud services and containerized architecture to automate and manage the entire workflow.

Technologies Used:

Amazon S3 – For storing original and transcoded video files

Amazon SQS – For message queuing and triggering events

Amazon ECS – For running the containerized transcoding service

Amazon ECR – For storing Docker container images

Docker – For containerization of the processing service

FFmpeg – For video transcoding into multiple resolutions

System Architecture:

Upload and Trigger:
A user uploads a video to a designated source S3 bucket. This upload event generates a notification that is sent to an SQS queue.

Message Processing:
A Docker container running on Amazon ECS listens to the SQS queue. When a message is received, the container:

Downloads the video from the S3 source bucket

Transcodes the video into multiple resolutions such as 360p, 480p, and 720p using FFmpeg

Post-Processing:
Once transcoding is complete, the new video files are uploaded to a target (production) S3 bucket. The SQS message is then deleted to confirm successful processing.

Features:

Event-driven automation using S3 event notifications and SQS

Multi-resolution video generation using FFmpeg

Containerized deployment with Docker for portability

Upload of optimized video files to a separate S3 production bucket

Error handling mechanisms to manage failures

IAM role and policy configurations for secure access control

Debugging and Testing:
Local testing and debugging of the Docker containers can be done using test video files and simulated SQS messages. Verbose logs and environment variables help in identifying issues during the transcoding or upload phases.

Security Best Practices:

Use the principle of least privilege when assigning IAM roles

Restrict access to S3 buckets and queues using bucket and resource policies

Enable logging and monitoring for all AWS resources used

Scalability Considerations:

The ECS service can be horizontally scaled based on the number of messages in the SQS queue

Stateless container design allows reliable performance in high-load scenarios.
