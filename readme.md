🎥 Scalable Video Transcoding Pipeline using AWS and Docker

This project implements a scalable, event-driven video transcoding pipeline that automatically processes uploaded videos, transcodes them into multiple resolutions, and stores optimized versions in Amazon S3. The system leverages AWS cloud services and containerization to provide a reliable and maintainable workflow.

🧰 Technologies Used
    📦 Amazon S3 – Storage for original and transcoded videos

    📩 Amazon SQS – Message queue for event-driven processing

    🐳 Docker – Containerization of the transcoding service

    🚢 Amazon ECS – Running containerized workloads at scale

    🏞️ Amazon ECR – Docker image repository

    🎞️ FFmpeg – Video transcoding tool for multiple resolutions

🏗️ System Architecture
Upload & Trigger

    User uploads video to a source S3 bucket

    S3 sends an event notification to an SQS queue

Message Processing

    Docker container running on ECS polls SQS messages

    On message receipt, downloads the video from S3

    Transcodes the video into multiple resolutions (360p, 480p, 720p) using FFmpeg

Post-Processing

    Uploads transcoded videos to the target production S3 bucket

    Deletes the SQS message after successful processing

✔️ Features
    🔄 Event-driven automation using S3 & SQS

    📺 Multi-resolution video transcoding (360p, 480p, 720p)

    🐋 Containerized transcoding service using Docker

    ☁️ Scalable deployment on AWS ECS

    🔒 Secure access with fine-grained IAM roles and policies

    ⚙️ Robust error handling and retry mechanisms

🔍 Debugging & Testing
    Local container testing with sample videos and simulated SQS events

    Detailed logging to identify and fix issues

    Environment variables to configure and tune behavior

🔐 Security Best Practices
    Principle of least privilege for IAM permissions

    Bucket policies to restrict access to S3 data

    Logging and monitoring enabled for AWS resources

📈 Scalability
    ECS service can scale out automatically based on SQS queue length

    Stateless container design supports load distribution and failover
